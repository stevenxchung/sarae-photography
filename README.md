Sarae Photography is a website designed to showcase Sarae's collection of photography and passion for traveling and exploring new places. This file will serve to track any major changes and updates to Sarae's website.

This repo includes the latest migration from legacy EJS + Node.js to Next.js since Heroku no longer offered a free-tier option and many new advances in web frameworks and distributed technologies such as [edge computing](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview) are now being offered as a better alternative option.

We currently use the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) to speed up the process from zero to production. Deployments will be managed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - the preferred way to host Next.js apps.
